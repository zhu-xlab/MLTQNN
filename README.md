Multitask Learning for Earth Observation Data Classification with Hybrid Quantum Network

This paper presents a hybrid model that incorporates multitask learning to assist efficient data encoding and employs a location weight module with quantum convolution operations to extract valid features for classification. The validity of our proposed model was evaluated using multiple EO benchmarks. Additionally, we experimentally explored the generalizability of our model and investigated the factors contributing to its advantage, highlighting the potential of QML in EO data analysis.
